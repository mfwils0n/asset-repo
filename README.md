## Contributing to this Wiki
Have an idea for a great reusable asset? Fantastic! Before you start developing, lets make sure there is a demand for what you have in mind. Follow the steps below to ensure you will be effectively using your time.
### 1. Search
  Thoroughly search existing assets to establish the uniqueness and validity of your idea. Refer to [Searching This Repo](#searching-this-repo).

### 2. Propose
  Once you're confident that your asset will not be redundant, reach out to **A Person** or **Another Person** and discuss your idea. This is your elevator pitch! Make sure to provide them with the pertinent technical details, such as:
  * The technologies that this will utilize, plus any other keywords that reveal methods used.
  * A 2 - 4 sentence summary of what the solution will be.
  * The problem it solves/the business value the asset holds.
  * Where does the basis for your idea come from? 
    * Directly from client 
    * Handed down by chapter/squad lead
    * Independently drafted 
    
  > For example:
  > * Technologies/Methods: `App Connect Enterprise (ACE)`, `ACE Toolkit`, `REST API`, `Oracle DB`, `CP4I`
  > * Summary: An ACE flow deployed on CP4I will monitor an internal Oracle database and make a POST request to a REST API external to the cluster every 2 minutes.
  > * Relevance: The client, a grocery store chain, has an internal (on prem) Oracle database that is used to maintain accurate inventory for each grocery store. The database is constantly updated through the Point-Of-Sale system every time a customer completes a transaction. The client wants their floor employees to be able to retrieve accurate inventory data through their mobile web application. The web app is external to the database, and so creating an API endpoint for it to use is a simple solution to bridge the gap.
  > * Basis: Client work for `Green Grocers`
  
### 3. Generate
  What are you waiting for? Let's get this show on the road! Here is where you develop & document your asset.
  
### 4. Review
  Time to show off what you've created. We suggest getting others' opinions on your asset, usually in the form of a live demo. If it's applicable, maybe even give people a chance to use your asset without direction. If they are successful with limited guidance from you, the creator, you've done good work.
  
### 5. Publish
  Congrats, your asset is ready for the real world. Commit it to this repo and make a pull request. One of our other contributors will come along and give the final thumbs up.
